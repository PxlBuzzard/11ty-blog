[Oculus-D-Rift](https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Oculus-D-Rift) is a D binding for the Oculus Rift. This version we are releasing is not feature-complete, nor is it ready for anything beyond testing and proof-of-concept. We are releasing our work so far with the hope that future developers will continue to fill in where we leave off, as well as offer suggestions for maintaining compatibility in future API changes.
