## The Website

## What Happened?

My initial reaction, as chronicled in an email to Kevin, is as follows:

> Holy crap dude.

I shouldn't have been too surprised. Emails leading up to that point were increasingly hesitant. See, Kevin and I were designers. Our work consisted of talking with a client, finding one or two websites by which they were inspired, and iterating on a design until we reached completion.

This project was not design. Myrta wanted a simple way to update the text on her website. That's it.

## Going Forward
