After I dug deep into the recesses of Facebook I found a post featuring...

Top 5 Albums in May 2009:

1. Underoath - <em>Define The Great Line</em>
2. August Burns Red - <em>Messengers</em>
3. Blindside - <em>A Thought Crushed My Mind</em>
4. He Is Legend - <em>I Am Hollywood</em>
5. Poison the Well - <em>Versions</em>

It's good to see a lot of overlap between the lists with a 3-year split between them. I identified a lot of powerful, genre-defining albums and they have been no less amazing as time goes on which speaks volumes about the bands' abilities.
