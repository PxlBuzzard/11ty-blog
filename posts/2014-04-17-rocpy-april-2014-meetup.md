With a remote call from Montreal, [decause](https://github.com/decause) brought a number of Python developers to us to pitch their projects and answer questions from us.

[Baptiste Mispelon](https://github.com/bmispelon), a Django developer, spoke quickly about the [Django project](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and what they were hacking on at the conference. I asked him if they were looking at revamping their [beginner tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/), a lengthy 6-part series that I believe scares away a number of potential users. He said there has been a divide between people who want to make the tutorial a solid base of knowledge for all aspects of Django versus folks who want to onboard new users as gently as possible. All that to say, no one has touched the tutorial and it isn't on the roadmap for the near future.

The rest of the meeting went well, I'm happy to see developers doing cool things no matter what language it's in.
