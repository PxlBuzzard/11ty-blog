I am going to gloss over [the meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Rochester-Python-Meetup/events/164013472/) itself, as I imagine numerous other blog posts will cover that ground. Instead I would like to highlight a chat that [Colden](http://coldencullen.com) and I had with Len Coia, a local programmer interested in picking up Python.

## Chromebooks for Development

The [CR-48](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook#Cr-48) that Google sent out to some thousands of people (including myself) was a basic piece of hardware. In order to disable boot protection you had to pull out the battery and flip a switch. To [modify the BIOS](http://cr-48.wikispaces.com/Open+the+Cr-48) you had unscrew the laptop and put a strip of electrical tape on the motherboard. Needless to say, getting another OS onto this machine was never intended by Google, and Len was willing to give Chrome OS a shot. But is the web ready for day-to-day programming?

## Coding Online

There are a growing number of editors available on the web ([Cloud9](https://c9.io/), [Koding](https://koding.com/), and [Compilr](https://compilr.com/) to name a few). However, none of these come close to the power of the behemoths (Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode) and I can't make any guesses as to when we will see something that powerful. If you want to work on web-based languages things are looking good, but beyond that we're still waiting for bigger and better editors.

## The D Language

Finally Colden and I spread the love of the [D Language](http://dlang.org/). The [Circular Studios](https://github.com/Circular-Studios) organization on Github is growing by the week, proving that D is more than ready for game programming and other intensive software. It's an exciting language and community to work with, and Len left the meetup promising to explore and learn.
