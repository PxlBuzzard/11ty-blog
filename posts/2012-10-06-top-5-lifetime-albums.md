After I dug deep into the recesses of Facebook I found a post featuring...

Top 5 Albums in May 2009:
<ol>
	<li>Underoath - <em>Define The Great Line</em></li>
	<li>August Burns Red - <em>Messengers</em></li>
	<li>Blindside - <em>A Thought Crushed My Mind</em></li>
	<li>He Is Legend -<em> I Am Hollywood</em></li>
	<li>Poison the Well - <em>Versions</em></li>
</ol>
It's good to see a lot of overlap between the lists with a 3-year split between them. I identified a lot of powerful, genre-defining albums and they have been no less amazing as time goes on which speaks volumes about the bands' abilities.
