I kept a journal of miscellaneous game-related thoughts as a kid. Over time I would like to digitize more of it, as there are a number of goodies (including a development blog of the first game I developed). To begin, I am publishing a review of Harvest Moon for the GameCube.

> Ok, Harvest Moon is quite literally a farming game at the bottom line. Before you say, "Boring!", the lines above the bottom line are quite interesting. One line is, ok, have you ever played Animal Crossing? If you haven't, it's a game that you can never beat, and do what you want to do whenever you want-to style. Same as Harvest Moon. If you feel like going for a wife, have at it. You wanna farm and tend the animals? Sure. Make friends and get special things because of it? Have at it. You can really be quite laid back with any of those or only focus on one while still having to do some things constant. Feed animals, water crops, get their product and sell it. Then you can do whatever you want. This game has excellent graphics and provides hours and hours of fun. It teaches many a thing about farming and relationships. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would stand strong at a 9. Its fail is that you wake up too early, meaning you have an extra hour or two without anyone awake at all. Other than that, this game is a definite must-have.
