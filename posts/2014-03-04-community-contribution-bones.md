In my work on the MAGIC Center website, I came across [a Wordpress theme](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) on Github that I noticed was running a fairly outdated version of [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/). I forked the repo, updated it, and submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones/pull/548). However, I hadn't originally noticed that the owner had included some custom code at the bottom of the file, so after he pointed that out I updated the files in my PR accordingly.
